The Antenna System and Waveguide experiment focuses on the fundamental principles of antenna systems and waveguide technology. This experiment introduces the different types of antennas, their respective advantages and disadvantages, and their practical applications in communication systems.

In addition, the experiment explores the basic principles of waveguides as specialized structures used to guide electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies. It also highlights the different equipment and accessories used with waveguides and explains their specific functions within the system.

Through hands-on analysis using antenna trainers and various waveguide components, students are able to observe, measure, and better understand the behavior of electromagnetic signals in practical applications.
