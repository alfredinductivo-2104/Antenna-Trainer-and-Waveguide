# ANTENNA SYSTEM 📡

---

## INTRODUCTION:

An antenna is a metallic device (transducer) that converts electric currents into electromagnetic waves for transmitting signals, and vice versa for receiving them. It acts as the essential interface between radio transmitters/receivers and free space, enabling wireless communication for devices like phones, radios, TV, and satellites.

Beyond this basic interface, an antenna's performance depends on its geometric design and resonant frequency. Because electromagnetic waves have specific wavelengths, an antenna must be "tuned" to a physical length that allows for maximum energy transfer. This relationship explains why antennas vary drastically in form, from massive broadcasting towers to the microscopic patches found inside modern smartphones.

The RF probe antenna is a specialized diagnostic tool used in antenna training systems. Although it is sometimes called a Current Probe Antenna, it is not designed for transmitting radio or TV signals. Instead, it functions as a sensor used to probe or measure the electrical current within another antenna.

### 2. LOG PERIODIC ANTENNA

The Log Periodic Antenna is a multi-element, directional antenna designed to operate over a very wide range of frequencies. This may be look like a Standand YAGI Antenna but unlike it, this type of antenna can pick up or transmit signals across a broad spectrum without needing to change antennas.

### 3. LOOP ANTENNA

The Loop Antenna is a magnetic field sensitive antenna. As seen in the image, there are loops of copper traces in the Antenna that acts as an inductor for the entire Antenna. This type of antenna was primarily used for receiving low-to-medium frequency signals

### 4. HERTZ ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3e91c18-c2a5-45a6-b382-199286f359f5" />

The Hertz Antenna is a type of Antenna named after Heinrich Hertz and known to be the most fundamental type of antenna. This type of antenna was commonly used to understand the fundamental principles of radiation and resonance.

### 5. RHOMBUS ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55bf2de3-ca00-4ef7-88c3-98fcdafd84f3" />

The Rhombus Antenna also known as Diamond Antenna, is a type of antenna that belongs to the traveling-wave family and is characterized by its diamond-shaped geometry. This type of antenna was conmmomly used for demonstrating Directional Transmissions, Broadband Performance, and Simulating Long-Distance Communications. 

### 6. YAGI-UDA SIMPLE 5 ELEMENTS ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46ad7f7f-a813-4cda-b412-242c61bf2d7a" />

The YAGI-UDA Antenna is considered as the most recognizable and widely used directional antenna designs in radio communication. This type of antenna was designed for high directivity. It works by focusing radio signals into a narrow beam, much like a flashlight focuses light. Additionally, this type of antenna was composed of three major parts:
- Reflector - which is the Longest and reflects the signal forward.
- Driven Element - which is the second one from the back and this is where the cable connects.
- Director - which is the shorter elements that focuses the signal in the direction the antenna is pointing.

### 7. YAGI-UDA FOLDED DIPOLE 3 ELEMENT ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0560a52e-2611-4fd3-ad13-1c7b212fe81d" />

Even though this type of Antenna shares he same DNA as the YAGI-UDA SIMPLE 5 ELEMENTS Antenna. This antenna features two key changes which are the folded driven element and a more compact 3-element configuration. The folded driven element increases the impedance that helps to makes impedance matching much easier to do with certain types of transmission lines. Additionally, With only three elements—one Reflector, one Folded Driven Element, and one Director. This antenna is smaller and lighter than the 5-element version.

### 8. YAGI-UDA SIMPLE 7 ELEMENTS ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd369f74-73bb-4cdf-9cfb-1263ebb89f68" />

Compare to the previous YAGI-UDA Antenna with less than 7 element, this type of YAGI Antenna is the most directional antenna.  With seven total elements—one reflector, one driven element, and five directors—this antenna has significantly more "reach" and can pick up much weaker signals than the 3 or 5-element versions.

### 9. PHASE ARRAY λ/2 ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45eb14f9-a627-4816-b358-332ac0786a92" />

A phased array is a collection of multiple antenna elements where the relative phases of the signals feeding the elements are varied. This allows the antenna's radiation pattern to be steered electronically without moving the physical structure. The λ/2 (half-wavelength) label indicates that the elements are spaced or sized exactly at half the wavelength of the target frequency. This specific spacing is critical to ensure that the signals from each element interfere constructively in the desired direction and destructively in others.

### 10. PHASE ARRAY λ/4 ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d8fa0c-2114-44b1-b2bf-0fff51749682" />

The Phase Array λ/4 ANTENNA  is a variation of the phased array family, specifically tuned using quarter-wavelength λ/4 elements or spacing .By using λ/4 (quarter-wave) segments instead of λ/2 (half-wave), the physical profile of the antenna elements is halved. This is often done to save space in compact electronic devices.

### 11. ANTENNA KIT A and B

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7bd6da-f50f-45da-8371-50b5bd721ef1" />

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8171333b-d956-4819-ac34-37ae8ea50ae1" />

This is a primary mounting block or feed-point housing used across this modular educational kit. It is designed for laboratory environments to allow students to quickly swap out different antenna configurations

### 12. BROAD SIDE ARRAY ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f62d609-7612-4d1d-a71c-56a02ca92a3d" />

The Broad Side Array Antenna is a type of antenna array where the direction of maximum radiation is perpendicular to the axis of the array. Unlike the Yagi antennas, which shoot the signal out of the front, this array radiates power primarily in two directions which are directly away from the flat sides of the board. This type of antenna provides a very narrow beam in the broadside direction, making it highly effective for certain types of long-range broadcasting.

### 13. SIMPLE DIPOLE ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d8fa0c-2114-44b1-b2bf-0fff51749682" />

The Simple Dipole Antenna is the most basic form of an antenna, consisting of two conductive rods of equal length. This is a half-wave dipole, which means that the total length of the two rods combined is approximately half the wavelength of the radio frequency it is designed to transmit or receive signals.

### 14. SIMPLE DIPOLE λ/2 ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/826886f5-0367-46e1-94f4-4c3bbc6a5010" />

It is a Simple Dipole λ/2 Antenna is the foundational standard for radio communication. It consists of two straight conductive rods of equal length, totaling approximately half the wavelength (λ/2) of its target frequency.

### 15. SIMPLE DIPOLE λ/4 ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96b638db-7cfb-4a80-a8b0-8bd953bc820f" />

It is a Simple Dipole Antenna specifically tuned as a quarter-wave (λ/4) resonator. Unlike a standard half-wave (λ/2) dipole, each arm of this antenna is approximately one-quarter of the target wavelength. Additionally, Because it is a shorter antenna, it often requires a ground plane to help it resonate efficiently.

### 16. SIMPLE DIPOLE 3/2λ ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96b638db-7cfb-4a80-a8b0-8bd953bc820f" />

The Simple Dipole 3/2λ is a long-wire variation of the classic dipole. While the λ/2 dipole is the most common, the 3/2λ offers unique characteristics. Because the physical structure is larger, it can capture more electromagnetic energy, providing higher gain in its primary lobes compared to a standard dipole.

### 17. FOLDED DIPOLE λ/2 ANTENNA

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90c7aa43-177e-4365-8984-2e94bc6e2c8e" />

This is the pure version of the folded driven element found in the YAGI-UDA folded dipole 3 element ANTENNA, but without the extra directors or reflectors. Without reflectors or directors to "push" the signal, this antenna radiates in a doughnut shape around the rod. Being a half-wave dipole, it is "resonant," which means that it is electrically tuned to be most efficient at a specific frequency.

## CONCLUSIONS:
After analyzing the gathered data and observations about Sampling and Reconstruction of a signal, the following conclusions have been made:
- Digital transmission requires analog signals to be converted into discrete samples for effective processing and transmission.
- Sampling a signal using the ETT-101 Dual Analog Switch Module successfully captures discrete values of the original message signal.
- Natural sampling was observed, as the signal’s voltage returns to zero between samples, and sample amplitudes vary with the original signal.
- The sample-and-hold scheme was demonstrated, with each sample holding a constant voltage during the sampling interval and no gaps between samples.
- Signal reconstruction using a low-pass filter restores the sampled signal to closely resemble the original, with the proper adjustments to gain and cut-off frequency improving fidelity.
- Aliasing occurs when the sampling frequency is too low, highlighting the importance of adhering to the Nyquist criterion.
