# ANTENNA SYSTEM

---

## INTRODUCTION:

An antenna is a metallic device (transducer) that converts electric currents into electromagnetic waves for transmitting signals, and vice versa for receiving them. It acts as the essential interface between radio transmitters/receivers and free space, enabling wireless communication for devices like phones, radios, TV, and satellites.

Beyond this basic interface, an antenna's performance depends on its geometric design and resonant frequency. Because electromagnetic waves have specific wavelengths, an antenna must be "tuned" to a physical length that allows for maximum energy transfer. This relationship explains why antennas vary drastically in form, from massive broadcasting towers to the microscopic patches found inside modern smartphones.

## TYPES OF ANTENNAS

### 1. Current Probe Antenna

The RF probe antenna is a specialized diagnostic tool used in antenna training systems. Although it is sometimes called a Current Probe Antenna, it is not designed for transmitting radio or TV signals. Instead, it functions as a sensor used to probe or measure the electrical current within another antenna.

### 2. Log Periodic Antenna

The Log Periodic Antenna is a multi-element, directional antenna designed to operate over a very wide range of frequencies. This may be look like a Standand YAGI Antenna but unlike it, this type of antenna can pick up or transmit signals across a broad spectrum without needing to change antennas.

### 3. Loop Antenna

The Loop Antenna is a magnetic field sensitive antenna. As seen in the image, there are loops of copper traces in the Antenna that acts as an inductor for the entire Antenna. This type of antenna was primarily used for receiving low-to-medium frequency signals

### 4. Hertz Antenna

## CONCLUSIONS:
After analyzing the gathered data and observations about Sampling and Reconstruction of a signal, the following conclusions have been made:
- Digital transmission requires analog signals to be converted into discrete samples for effective processing and transmission.
- Sampling a signal using the ETT-101 Dual Analog Switch Module successfully captures discrete values of the original message signal.
- Natural sampling was observed, as the signal’s voltage returns to zero between samples, and sample amplitudes vary with the original signal.
- The sample-and-hold scheme was demonstrated, with each sample holding a constant voltage during the sampling interval and no gaps between samples.
- Signal reconstruction using a low-pass filter restores the sampled signal to closely resemble the original, with the proper adjustments to gain and cut-off frequency improving fidelity.
- Aliasing occurs when the sampling frequency is too low, highlighting the importance of adhering to the Nyquist criterion.
